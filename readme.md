# Project Setup and Usage

## Installation

To set up the project environment, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Running the Notebook

Once the dependencies are installed, open the notebook and run all the cells from top to bottom.

No additional setup is required.
